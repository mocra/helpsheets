h2. What is git?

bq. Git is a free & open source, distributed version control system  designed to handle 
    everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

When you work on any project, on your own or collaborativly it is important to use some kind of version control. Most people 
working with Ruby choose to use Git. This short guide will teach _the bare minimum_ ammount of git you need to know to deploy 
you rails app to _heroku_ and have a way to fix things if they break using version control.

h3. Installing Git

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby") do -%>
# call-seq:
#    render_page    => string
#
# Apply the desired filters to the page. The filters to apply are
# determined from the page's meta-data.
#
def render_page
  ary = []
  str = ::Webby::File.read(@page.path)

  @page.filter.to_a.each do |filter|
    str = self.send(filter + '_filter', str)
  end

  str
end
<% end -%>
h3. Using Git

After you have created your new project navigate to your project folder with terminal and use the command @git init@ to create 
a .git folder in your projects root directory. This folder holds all the information git needs to version your project.

We can break the rest up into 3 simple steps.

# *Add your project files*
This is to tell git what files are new, what files have changed and what files are going to be deleted. The first time you do 
this you will want to add every file within your projects root directory so use the command @git add .@.
# *Commit your project files*
Commiting your project files basically says "All the files you just added are going to be grouped together in a version" this 
is where you can add a _commit message_ so if you need to come back to it later you know what stage the project was up to when 
you commited the files. To commit the files you added in the previous step use the command @git commit -m "Initial commit"@ the 
@-m@ flag adds the commit message ("initial commit")
# *Push your project files (to heroku)*


h2. What is Heroku?

p(sidenote). Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing.

Heroku is a fantastic platform for deploying small rails apps...

# @sudo gem install heroku@
This installs a _ruby gem_ called _heroku_ that will control our online applications through the use of the _heroku_ command.
# @heroku create myapp@
Because we have now installed the _heroku_ gem we can now use the _heroku_ command to create a place to host our application 
on _heroku_.
# @git push heroku master@
