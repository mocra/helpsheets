Cucumber is a tool that can execute plain-text functional descriptions as automated tests.


<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
gem install cucumber
script/generate cucumber --caypabara
<% end -%>

Create a new file in the _/features_ folder called _is_there_a_homepage.feature_ with the following steps in it:

<% coderay(:lang => "cuke") do -%>
Feature: Is there a homepage
  In order for people to see the homepage
  The homepage should exist
  
  Scenario: Going to the homepage
    Given I am on the homepage
    Then I should see "<text>"
<% end -%>

Replace @<text>@ with any text that appears on the homepage. 

You have now written your first test, time to run it!

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ rake cucumber

  Using the default profile...
  Feature: Is there a homepage
    In order for people to see the homepage

    Scenario: Going to the homepage # features/create_tweet.feature:5
      Given I am on the homepage    # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:18
      Then I should see "Timeline"  # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:99
