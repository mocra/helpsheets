h2. The software we will be using

We have compiled a list of software that we will be using over the course of the next few weeks and hopefully if you will continue to use it for many years to come. If you have any problems installing any of the software below please contact us prior to the course so that we can sort out any problems before we get started and don't waste any time on the day.

h3. This guide has been broken up into three sections: 

"OS X":#osx, "Windows":#windows and "Unix/Linux":#linux

<a name="osx"></a>

h2. OS X

h3. Ruby 1.8.6/1.8.7

Ruby on OS X comes with the developer tools that can be found on your installation disk.

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ ruby -v
ruby 1.8.7 (2009-06-08 patchlevel 173) [universal-darwin10.0]
<% end -%>

h3. RubyGems

RubyGems is the standard Ruby package manager. You should already have this as it comes with OS X 10.5+ but you will want to update it:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ sudo gem update --system
$ gem -v
1.3.5
<% end -%>

h3. Rails 2.3.5

You are now ready to install rails, open up terminal and type the following:

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ sudo gem install rails
$ rails -v
2.3.5
<% end -%>

h3. Git

p(sidenote). Git is for source control, deployment and access to the 1000s of Ruby/Rails open source projects.

"Download Git 1.7":http://git-osx-installer.googlecode.com/files/git-1.7.0.3-intel-leopard.dmg or "Download latest version":http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/

Open the DMG and install the package.

<% coderay(:lang => "bash") do -%>
$ git --version
git version 1.7.0.3
<% end %> 

h3. Text Editor

p(sidenote). "A bad craftsman blames his [bad] tools."

This is what you are going to be spending most of your time in so use something you are comfortable with that also has good syntax highlighting support.

p(sidenote). Mocra loves TextMate.

* "Textmate":http://macromates.com/ - free for 30 days or more; 100s of extensions
* "RadRails":http://www.radrails.org/ - free; built on Eclipse/Java
* "Vim":http://www.vim.org/ - free; the legend of terminal editors

h3. Screen Sharing

Instructors will teach by showing your own computer on the communal projector. How? Via screen sharing.

Turn on screen sharing:

# Go into your _'System Preferences'_
# Open _'Sharing'_
# Tick _'Screen Sharing'_
# Open _'Computer Settings'_
# Tick _'Anyone may request permission to control screen'_
