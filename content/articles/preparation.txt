h2. The software we will be using

We have compiled a list of software that we will be using over the course of the next few weeks and hopefully if you will continue to use it for many years to come. If you have any problems installing any of the software below please contact us prior to the course so that we can sort out any problems before we get started and don't waste any time on the day.

h3. This guide has been broken up into three sections: 

"OS X":#osx, "Windows":#windows and "Unix/Linux":#linux

<a name="osx"></a>

h2. OS X

# *Ruby 1.8.6/1.8.7*
Ruby on OS X comes with the developer tools that can be found on your installation disk.
# *RubyGems*
RubyGems is the standard Ruby package manager. You should already have this as it comes with OS X but you will want to update it:
<% coderay(:lang => "javascript") do -%>
$ gem update --system
$ gem -v
1.3.5
<% end -%>

# *Rails 2.3.5*
You are now ready to install rails, open up terminal and type the following:
<% coderay(:lang => "javascript") do -%>
$ gem install rails
$ rails -v
2.3.5
<% end -%>

# *Git*
The easiest way to get Git on OS X is using the git-osx-installer, download your copy from "http://git-osx-installer.googlecode.com/files/git-1.7.0.3-intel-leopard.dmg":http://git-osx-installer.googlecode.com/files/git-1.7.0.3-intel-leopard.dmg and install.
# *A syntax highlighting text editor*
This is what you are going to be spending most of your time in so use something you are comfortable with that also has good syntax highlighting support.
## "Textmate":http://macromates.com/ (Everyone at Mocra uses (and loves to use) "Textmate":http://macromates.com/ and I highly reccomend giving it a go.)
## "RadRails":http://www.radrails.org/
## "Vim":http://www.vim.org/
# *Screensharing*
To turn on screensharing in OS X go into your _'System Prefrences'_, click _'Sharing'_ and tick _'Screen Sharing'_, *make sure you also tick* _'Anyone may request permission to control screen'_ under _'Computer Settings'_.
